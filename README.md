# Health-Insurance-GUI
This is a project from my PLC which is a GUI for a health insurance program that allows the user to enter personal and relevant details and then receive a quote that is calculated based on the details entered. You can find a demo of my project [here.](https://youtu.be/OTzkRXZAovs)
